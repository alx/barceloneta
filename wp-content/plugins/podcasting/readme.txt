Adds full podcasting support to WordPress.

== Description ==

Created for the Google Summer of Code 2007, Podcasting brings complete podcasting support to WordPress. Taking advantage of the latest and greatest in WordPress 2.5, WordPress podcasting has never been so easy.

= Features =

- Full iTunes support (both feed and item tags).
- A dedicated podcasting feed that can stand alone or be applied to any archive, category, or tag page.
- Support for multiple formats (or podcasts) with each format receiving their own dedicated feed.
- Offers a podcast player that can be included in any post.
- A simple, easy to use interface.
- Fully integrates with WordPress' existing enclosure support and takes advantage of WordPress 2.5's new plugin API.

= Usage =

Feed, iTunes, and format options can be configured in WordPress' Options > Podcasting page.

Episodes can be added, edited, and deleted via the Podcasting options box displayed on posts' edit screen. The box appears below the image uploading section and can be rearranged with the other options boxes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `podcasting` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Configure your podcasting feed through the 'Settings' > 'Podcasting' menu in WordPress.
1. Begin adding new episodes to posts!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help, the podcasting feed is resulting in a 404! =

WordPress 2.5 slightly changed the upgrade procedure. Stored rewrite rules (such as Podcasting's) are dumped after an upgrade to prevent issues. From now on, [rewrite rules must be refreshed](http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress_Extended#Step_10:_Update_Permalinks_and_.htaccess) as part of the upgrade procedure.

Alternatively, if the pretty feed URLs aren't working period, you can also use the following URL structure:

`http://example.com/?feed=podcast`
`http://example.com/?feed=podcast&format=x`

= My m4a/m4b files disappear after saving the page! =

Most web servers do not recognize m4a/m4b as an audio file by default, therefore causing Podcasting to ignore the URL. Thankfully, this can be corrected easily. Open up the .htaccess file in your WordPress installation's root directory and add the following two lines:

`AddType audio/x-m4a .m4a`
`AddType audio/x-m4b .m4b`
